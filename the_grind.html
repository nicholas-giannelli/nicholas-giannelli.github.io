<h1>What is "The Grind"?</h1>
	<p>"The Grind" is a YouTube series that documented the Dynamic Wrestling Academy's youth wrestlers as they traveled across the country competing in high level tournaments. During my time working for "The Grind", I was the video editor editor for the show. I got to travel with the team, film all of their matches, interview the athletes, and edit the footage into reality tv style youtube videos.
