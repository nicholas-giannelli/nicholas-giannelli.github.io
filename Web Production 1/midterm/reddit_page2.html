<p>It's very rare to see judo techniques performed in mixed martial, so when it is done on the highest stage we should stop and admire it.
		Notice how Cub is able to drag all of his opponents weight fowards by applying pressure on the overhook. This foward pressure allows Cub
	  to rotate his hips inwards at the right moment, re-directing all of his weight and causing his opponent to flip over.</p>
		<p>This also goes to show that judo throws can be perfomed without the use of a gi. Often people get the wrong impression that 
		judo can only be perfomed due to the gi they wear. However as we see here, judo can be perfomed at the highest level without the gi.</p>

		  <p>Cub is a black belt in jiu jitsu under Master Machado. He's very skilled and has also perfomed some other huge throws in the octagon before.
		  His <i>koshiguruma</i> is very strong and highly developed. Awesome to see judo perfomed in the ufc!</p>
