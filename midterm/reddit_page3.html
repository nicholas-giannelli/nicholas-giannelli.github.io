	  <p> <b> What is your guys favorite comic book series?</b></p>
    <img src="blackest-night.jpeg" width="250" height="375" alt=""/> 
	  <p>My personal favorite comic line has gotta be "The Blackest Night" by Geoff Johns. I always found the
		different types of power rings very interesting and these comics expand on those powers a lot. I also really
			enjoyed the main villain of the series Nekron.</p>

	  <p><em>Nekron</em></p>
		<p>Geoff Johns was able to bring back major characters who died in previous comics through Nekron
		summoning the dead and white lanterns saving their souls. In my opinion this was done brilliantly
		and places "The Blackest Night" as my favorite comic series of all time. But now I'm curious, what 
		are <i>your</i> favorite comic series and <i>why?</i></p>

		  <p>Oh man, Blackest Night is definitely up there in my top picks too! My all time favorite comics have to be "Watchmen" by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons.
		  "Watchmen" did something no one else was doing in the superhero genre. It offered a new view of the roles heroes play in their societies. It's complex
		  characters and nonlinear storytelling place it as my all time favorite.</p>

		  <p>For me it's gott be X-Men: Days of Future Past for no other reason than pure nostalgia. One of the first comics I've ever read and it will always have a special place in my heart.</p>
